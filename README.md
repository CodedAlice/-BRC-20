Move Ordinals to Layer 2
This Python script allows you to move a list of ordinals to Layer 2. It interacts with the baselayer and layer2 modules to create a transaction, sign it, submit it to Layer 2, and retrieve the results. The script incorporates error handling and validation to ensure the process is executed correctly.

Features
Validates the input ordinals to ensure they are positive integers.
Signs the transaction using a private key obtained from baselayer.
Submits the transaction to Layer 2 and retrieves the results.
Raises custom exceptions for invalid ordinals and transaction failures.
Provides informative error messages for troubleshooting.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
baselayer module
layer2 module
Usage
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Set up the baselayer and layer2 modules with the required configurations and connection details.
Modify the ordinals list in the if __name__ == "__main__": block to include the ordinals you want to move to Layer 2.
Run the script using Python: python move_ordinals.py.
The script will validate the ordinals, create and sign a transaction, submit it to Layer 2, and retrieve the results.
If the transaction is successful, the script will print the moved ordinals.
If any errors occur during the process, custom exception messages will be displayed.
Error Handling
The script includes two custom exception classes:

InvalidOrdinalError: Raised when an invalid ordinal is passed as input.
TransactionFailedError: Raised when the transaction fails, providing the specific error message.
You can handle these exceptions in your code to provide appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.

Security Considerations
Ensure that the private key used for signing the transaction is securely managed and accessible only to authorized entities.
Implement appropriate access controls and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the baselayer and layer2 modules.
Follow security best practices and guidelines for key management, secure coding, and data protection.
